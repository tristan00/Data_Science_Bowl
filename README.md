started by predicting if a pixel was part of a neuclie then clustering. Clustering did not work well. <br />
Attempting to train 2 models, 1 to predict edges, 1 to predict neuclie. This should make the last clustering step easier. Will try clustering both with kmeans and graph cover algorithms.<br />
