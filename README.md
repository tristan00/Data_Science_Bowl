First pass<br />
started by predicting if a pixel was part of a neuclie then clustering. Clustering did not work well. <br />
Attempting to train 2 models, 1 to predict edges, 1 to predict neuclie. This should make the last clustering step easier. Will try clustering both with kmeans and graph cover algorithms. result .28<br />
<br />
<br />
fcn for bnothj image and edge detection. Erosion and classification of pixels removed by edges and erosion to clean up results. result: .364<br />
<br />
Next, 3 class clasiification to get different type of edges. Better preproccessing. Some clustering and unsupervised image edge completion.<br />
