First pass<br />
started by predicting if a pixel was part of a neuclie then clustering. Clustering did not work well. <br />
Attempting to train 2 models, 1 to predict edges, 1 to predict neuclie. This should make the last clustering step easier. Will try clustering both with kmeans and graph cover algorithms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, read pixels in fcn, pixel by pixel is far too intensive.<br />
