# Data_Science_Bowl




gameplan:
Train models to determine if pixel is neuclei
Build map of predicted neuclei
Build splitting algorithm to get logical neuclei


Done:
Basic model based on image and image gradient, ~80% accuracy for determining if pixel is part of neuclei

to do:
look into extracting image metadata as fetures

experiment with:
    other nan replacement
    different input feature sizes
    stacked models and other model types
